tell us what we just learned about the specific libs and external apis we're using as succinctly as possible. only specific undocumented quirks, not general practices. don't include anything already obvious from the docs. consolidate related points into single entries. ultrathink about each point and if it can be combined into one

add one line bullet point to CLAUDE.md with what we just learned

check if there is a CLAUDE.md in a subdir that is closer to the context / code of what we learned
if not, put it in the project root CLAUDE.md
